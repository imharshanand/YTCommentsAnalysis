i was watching u not what u said. SubhanAllah
Can i leave non-washable N95 or surgery masks out in the sun to disinfect them?
"Wear mask only when explicitly requested by idiots. 
It's useless anyway."
Your hair is beautiful love the color
"I wish I had bought a N95 when this thing first started... It's the only one that actually works. Bloody surgical mask makes me sweat so much when I have to go out to buy necessities...
COMMON CLOTH DOESN'T PROTECT YOU AGAINST COVID-19!
It's just some sort of fashion item. Unless it's made of polypropylene or some other non woven technical fabric."
Good info thanks
Wear a mask.
"Good idea to have a beautiful lady making public service announcements, ensures people are paying attention."
You protect me I protect you
I love this in the UK they are telling us not to wear masks !!
People who wear masks but not gloves must be the libtards...

"Do try to get hold of the Iranian Face masks. They appear to be the only ones using Ion & Salts which kill the virus vs the ones distributed here that are only filters. Google them. Others confirm the effectiveness.

Oh I thought it was meant to support your chin? That's how I see people wear it.
I don't understand if the virus sticks to the mask so you have to be careful when you take it off and wash it if is not disposable when what do you do about the cloths you are wearing....I can see why you would wear a mask if you are sick but if you are not it seem quite useless.
Talks too fast. olor
Does being asthmatic add more danger if I caught the virus? And by how much exactly?
"There's a lot about washing hands, but what about washing your face, neck, arms - basically all skin areas that are exposed? These areas are not covered by masks / cloth, and we could catch some droplets on our skin anywhere else thus spread it around. Any thoughts about this?"
"In my country (the Czech Republic) we've been required to wear face masks whenever in public for more than two weeks by now. I'm still curious what the results are going to be, I was expecting to more countries to follow with similar regulations but apparently we're almost on our own with this."
"i have some n95 masks, but not many. how would i make sure that they remain sanitary? i know the virus dies after 9 hours on absorbent materials, if i were to spend at least 9 hours between outings without touching the mask would i be able to use it again?"
i have a question how to treatment in our immune system while there coronavirus out there
"this ""virus"" is just an experiment by the corrupt politicians and big pharma"
great information and well spoken Dr. Seema Yasmin!
1:18 those look great!
"You all look ridiculous. this is a hoax, wake up and think!! use your critical thinking skills!"
*Glad someone said it: **3:56*
"My nose itched, and unthinkingly, I scratched. I sanitized my nose and lip with hand sanitizer. Yeuch. If nothing else, a mask would've reminded me NOT to touch my face."

Nothing at all about eye protection??? You can wear a mask as much as you want but Corona can enter through the eyes as well...
#ThankYou
how about using my wife bra and make it into a mask? Will it offer better protection then cloth?
"It's much like toilet paper; people go out of their way to get it, but end up not knowing how to correctly use it."
Good point

QUEEN. miss seema yasmin spreading good information and being a british queen YASSSS.  💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
I was lucky enough to already have a mask with a n95 filter for my severe allergies. So i have good protection. I hope more people are taking this seriously now.
"I love her voice, so soothing"
Thanks Doc
"Big thumbs up! Short, informative, to the point, no bs. Thank you Wired and thank you Dr. Seema Yasmin."
Why are people wearing burkas

STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE OR MASK. 

If you touch your face or mask, you failed, game over. The entire point of wearing the mask is to prevent this. 

Touching your mask contaminates the mask and this is how you get infected. 

Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. You don’t need a mask. 

Just stop touching your face."
"Wholesale&Retail Face Mask! If you need KN95 mask, plz contact me. WhatsAPP/iMessage: +86 17139560967"
"Question, how can it protect others but not you it’s made of the same materials both ways...."
This series with this doctor is great 👍🏻
I was at Walmart the other day and an employee was wearing a mask just over her mouth. She kept touching it to adjust it on her face or taking it off to talk. Why even bother at that point 🤦‍♀️
"Unrelated, but I am in *love* with her eyeshadow look❤"
"I can't concentrate, she's too stunning."
"I only have one N95 mask, how do i disinfect ? with Soap or letting Dry on Sun ?"
I use my nose hairs to filter out coronavirus 🤗. Haven’t gotten sick yet
Cloth masks don't prevent anything. Don't expect them to keep you safe. Buy actual masks.
"It bothers me that this video is over four minutes long.  She could have covered the necessary points in less than half that.  But as far as I can tell most people actually need to be told five times before something will ""sink in""  :("
Wear eye protection with masks! Why cover just your mouth and nose while leaving eyes exposed to contagions?
"If you need to know do and donts on doing pr wearing simple task, go commit uninstall brain."
I wish the CDC would start telling people to stop yelling and talking loudly in public.
"The CDC doesn't even use the term ""mask"".  They use the highly-specific phrase ""Cloth face covering"".  Unfortunately, it seems the general public doesn't like to think that hard and has taken immediately to using the term ""mask"", which is going to produce more panic buying and fear-based profiteering opportunities."
I bet the comments are thirsty
"Wired muddies it up even more.  Wear the best masks that you can buy, or prepare to painfully drop dead."
"Theres no confusion. Any mask helps more than nothing, medical masks help more. The cdc and jerome adams lied to america saying that masks do not help. They lied to america so that medical personnel hopefully wouldn't have a shortage. They should have just told the truth that they didn't want medical personnel  to have a shortage, but just like they lied about the evali outbreak last summer, they lied about masks not helping.  #firethesurgeongeneral !"
Such a beautiful woman ❤️😍!
👏😎
Thank you Dr. Seema for some very valuable advice. It's sad to see our President come on national TV and say that he personally will NOT be prescribing to the CDC guideline as it might come in the way of his good looks. Glad to see you are spreading the wisdom in taking precautions.
Did you change your hair color. Love it ❤❤❤
I could have a literal gas mask on and still not feel secure.
"Awww, she moved the Emmy!"
"Had they done this in January instead of April....50% fewer cases that would also have prevented the hysteria about PPE and ventilators.  Had the CDC/FDA not blocked test kits, we'd have done test and trace.  The guidelines ensured the pandemic's rise in the USA, gave it time to ensure the most medical spending for the worst outcomes, not healthcare, but sick care."
Are her teeth made out of plastic??
Yasmin is best 💙
I DM’d her on her social media and she actually replied.
Its so easy to pay attention to someone as beautiful as Dr Seema.
omg this doctor is amazing

"You don't need to put it in the laundry after use. Just put it in boiling water in a saucepan with a bit of washing liquid for a minute while you wash your hands, drain, rinse in cold water, wring it out and let it dry.
Keeps it smelling nice too. :)"

"We needs toilets here in India, not Corona wirus. Too many street poopers ☹️. Like kardo guyz 👍"
"I find it hilarious how, instead of recomending reusable half-face or full-face masks with P100/P3 filters, they're recommending DYI cloth material over your face as to not exhaust the disposable mask supply. Why not be honest and recommend reusable masks instead? Each pair of filters last for months if you only use them while walking around."
"It seems all common sense to me, but hey, it's better said explicitly than not"
Your. Teeth. Are. Perfect.
"If this doctor sat on my face, would that count as a mask? Lets conduct an experiment..."

"Bruh, who TF framed the camera shot at 1:18 🧐🙄"
1:18 eyes on Masks OK!!🤨
Thank you! You have definitely cleared a lot up for me and my family.
The problem is not only about if masks should be worn in public or the type of mask you should wear and the proper way to wear it the real problem is about how people actually dispose a mask because I have been seeing alot of  masks been disposed in the road even after the w.h.o (world health organization ) explained and the  government explained it still happens knowing that even the wrong way of disposing it can easily spread the virus
What do with dog : youtu.be/a3KGBPQ3MoQ
Hospitals in my country are finding it difficult to get masks because people bought them all when the pandemic started
"Do's and dont's, I was expecting something like: Don't sneeze in it while wearing (and put it right back on your face) 😏"
"I'm amazed that Americans need people to stuff groceries in their carts even now. Like they can't do that by themselves. No wonder you're the most infected country on the planet. Well, that plus Trump 😁"
Nice lips
I see so many people who wear masks but leave their nose exposed...like wtf are you doing??
"Remember: social distance, masks, etc are to _slow_ it down, to give health professionals time to react. It's like sandbags in a flood. The better we all are at slowing it down, the better the outcome will be for all of our long-term health."
OMG why complicate things? Just wear a mask like we asians do.
Minister of my State has made compulsory today for every one to wear mask else legal action might be taken😊
Great piece! Thanks! I'm sharing this.
"Siamo una sola cosa tutte le nazioni  siamo sempre uniti 
Questo e un periodo brutto per tutti  ma passerà 
Chi a perso i loro cari 
Oi non tollero che facciano del commercio sulle mascherine 
Dovrebbero  distribbuirle 
Graduitamente
A tutti senza un soldo sia guanti  che mascherine 
Invece ne mettono a caro prezzo in tutte le fermacie 
E non pensano che la gente muoiono 
Non anno un soldo per comprare
Non dovrebbe esserci questa camorra
Si perche è camorra così
Dovrebbero esserci 
Piu guardie fuori alle fermacie per controllare 
Per quando la vendono 
E dovrebbero mettere 
Una vera punizione 
Perche le farmacie 
Ne approfittano 
Vi saluto 
Andra tutto bene 
Forza per tutti💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
